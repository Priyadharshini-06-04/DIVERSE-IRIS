Our team developed an interactive multi-metric dashboard that transforms global Earth data into actionable insights, addressing the NASA Space Apps Challenge, “From Earthdata to Action.” Using Python, Dash, and Plotly, we leveraged the Gapminder dataset to visualize GDP per capita, life expectancy, population, and GDP growth trends across countries and continents.

The dashboard allows users to select a continent, countries, year, and metrics, and instantly generate 7 types of charts—scatter, bubble, bar, histogram, line, choropleth, and box plots. This flexibility enables researchers, policymakers, educators, and local communities to compare countries, track trends over decades, and analyze correlations between economy, health, and population.

By turning complex data into clear, interactive visualizations, our solution bridges the gap between information and action. Locally, it can highlight regions needing intervention and support resource allocation; globally, it can inform sustainable development strategies and track global trends.

This project is important because it empowers decision-makers and communities to understand, plan, and act using Earth data, making development initiatives more effective, equitable, and scalable worldwide.
